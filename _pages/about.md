I'm Zhengyi Wang, a PhD student at Tsinghua University on **Machine Learning**. I'm advised by Prof. [Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) and Prof. [Hang Su](https://www.suhangss.me/). My lab is [TSAIL](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

I got my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** at Tsinghua University in 2021. I got my Minor degree in **Music** at Tsinghua University in 2021.

My research interests lie on Deep Generative Model, Adversarial Robustness and 3D Vision.
